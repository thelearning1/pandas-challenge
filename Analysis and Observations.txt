Observations---

1. The playerbase is very obviously centered around the ages of 20 and 25, approaching half of the total customer base
   breaking down the gender demographics within the age groups might produce interesting results.

2. while males have the most purchases by a longshot, they do have the lowest average purchase 
   of the group. Females and others/non-disclosed have a higher propensity for more expensive purchases.
   They may tend towards items of observably higher quality, assuming the items are priced based on their cost of production.

3. While the majority of purchases are made by the largest group of players (ages 20-25), there is an interesting grouping of
   high purchase averages across the 30-39 age groups. This could imply a small, yet dedicated playerbase of adults established 
   in their professional careers with money to spend and an interest in higher value items. 


Business suggestion:

While looking for actionable data using a dummy business, we can only go so far.

However, based on the numbers used for the assignment, I would suggest two focuses to company leadership.

1. The obvious one: Focus on making low-to-moderate production cost items focused on your largest playerbase, the males ages 20-24.
   they aren't as likely to have a lot of disposable income, but their free time and generational likelihood to find value in
   in-game purchases will always cause them to be repeat buyers. Quantity might outpace quality here.

2. The high-risk high-reward: Depening on the gender->age ratios in the playerbase, making very high quality items focused on the
   purchase patterns of the 30-40 demographics would likely yield good results. The 20-24 age group would likely see 
   good purchases of these items due to sheer volume in that group, but the margins in the categories that have more disposablie income
   and a higher bar for quality would yield steep profits for fewer items. Certainly not demographics to be ignored.
